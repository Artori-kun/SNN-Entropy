# Generate a synthetic spike train with different types of spikes
# including regular spike (poisson), burst spikes, periodic spikes, and silent spikes
# The generated spike trains are in binary format, where 1 indicates a spike and 0 indicates no spike.
# These spike trains have dimensions (n, t), where n is the number of neurons and t is the time steps.

class SpikeTrainGenerator:
    # 1. Regular spikes (Poisson process)
    # generate 2 types of regular spikes: homogeneous and inhomogeneous
    # homogeneous: constant rate
    # inhomogeneous: varying rate over time
